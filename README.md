### Reservation - Upsert API

API for upserting (updating or inserting) reservation data with these requirements:

1. Can accept two kinds of payload formats: Airbnb and Bookingcom
2. Parse and save the payloads to a Reservation model that belongs to a Guest
3. Can accept changes to the reservation and the guest (An improvement from my end ðŸ˜„)
4. Rollback changes when the updating guest fails

#### Code structure

1. [Reservation Controller](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/blob/main/app/controllers/api/v1/reservations_controller.rb#L8-L20)
2. [::Reservations::Upsert](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/blob/main/app/services/reservations/upsert.rb)
3. [::Reservations::Payload::Identifier](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/blob/main/app/services/reservations/payload/identifier.rb)
4. [::Reservations::Payload::Converter](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/tree/main/app/services/reservations/payload/converter) - [Here](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/blob/main/app/services/reservations/upsert.rb#L31-L35) using [Factory Method (Design Pattern)](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)
   a. [::Reservations::Payload::Converter::Airbnb](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/tree/main/app/services/reservations/payload/converter/airbnb) - To convert Airbnb payload to a standardized structure
   b. [::Reservations::Payload::Converter::Airbnb](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/tree/main/app/services/reservations/payload/converter/bookingcom) - To convert Bookingcom payload to a standardized structure
5. [::Reservations::Update](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/blob/main/app/services/reservations/update.rb) - To update the reservation and the guest. And it's using `Dry::Transactions` so it will rollback if one of the process failed. For example, if the updating guest fails, the reservation changes will be rollback.
6. [::Reservations module](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/blob/main/app/services/reservations.rb) - To store common methods that probably will be reused. And for namespacing based on it's domain, specifically for this case: Reservations.

#### How to add a new channel?

1. Add a new identifier on [::Reservations::Payload::Identifier](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/blob/main/app/services/reservations/payload/identifier.rb)
2. Create a new converter under [::Reservations::Payload::Converter](https://github.com/shabanzo/hometime/tree/main/app/services/reservations/payload/converter)
